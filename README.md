This program reads an incomplete CSV table of conjugated verbs in German and fills it in with entries that are easily computed (past and future forms, except Pr√§teritum).

If a required entry is missing, an assertion error is thrown.

The output is a .txt file which can be imported to anki. I have not yet added the card template to the repository.

## USAGE

`python complete-table.py`

## TODO

1. Complete table, add CSV table, add TXT file
2. Add anki card template
