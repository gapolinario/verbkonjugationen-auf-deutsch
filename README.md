This program reads an incomplete CSV table of conjugated verbs in German and fills it in with entries that are easily computed (past and future forms, except Pr√§teritum).

Usage: `python complete-table.py`

If a required entry is missing, an assertion error is thrown.

The other two executables generate output formatted for Anki.

With `python export-full.py`, the full table is converted to a .txt file.

With `python export-abridged.py`, a shorter .txt file is generated. It contains only basic examples, from which the conjugations for other pronouns can be derived.

It is impractical to study the full .txt file. Instead, it is meant as a source for self assessment, by randomly drawing cards from it. To learn the conjugations for new verbs, the shorter version is preferred.

Both .txt files can be imported to anki. I have not yet added the card templates to the repository.

## TODO

1. Complete table, add CSV table, add TXT file
2. Add anki card template
